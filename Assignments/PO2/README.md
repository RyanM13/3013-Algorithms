## P02 - Linear Search - Using Json
### Ryan Mathews
### Description:

This program takes a dictionary Json file which is than loaded into main.cpp. We use a file called console to print out a formatted console that looks good. We use our getch header file to grab different characters for input. The purpose is to type a word into the terminal and when you find a single word the definition will print out beneath it.
